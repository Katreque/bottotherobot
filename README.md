## How it Works

Botto provides useful functions and tools to power-up your Discord bot, totally free. With Botto is possible to:

- Generate roles, channels and it's permissions based on your template with a single command.
- Users are able to get/remove the allowed roles to themselves.
- Add your own code to Botto.

All you need to deal is the hosting. (AWS provides a 12 months free hosting if you need)
